# Lab 1a: Interactive Web Mapping

**Instructor:** Bo Zhao, 206.685.3846 or zhaobo@uw.edu

 **Points Available** = 50

In this lab, we will make an interactive choropleth web map that allows you to see more information when hovering above certain areas. You will be guided to make a web map showing state-level population densities in the U.S. You will load a local GeoJSON file and add it as a map layer, similar to what you did in our previous lab. Then you will need to use different colors for different population density values, add a title and a legend. Lastly and most importantly, you will write code that allow you to see specific values when you hover your mouse over a specific state. As for your final deliverable for this lab, you will be asked to create a different interactive choropleth map using the COVID-19 related dataset that we provide.
