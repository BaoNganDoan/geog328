# Summer 2023: GEOGRAPHY 328 - Web GIS

**Instructor:** Bo Zhao | zhaobo@uw.edu | Office Hour: Thursdays 1:00 to 4:00 PM by [appointment](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUZvU2gxXzVlZnZpfGRlZmF1bHR8NzM4ODA5MzUyNjAxZDU2Y2ViNTZiMzk2ZmM0N2VmNzI)

 Web-based Geographic Information Systems (Web GIS), which combines web, mobile technology, and GIS, is a rapidly growing and promising area in both academia and industry. It has expanded the capabilities of GIS from local servers to the cloud, making online maps and geospatial intelligence more accessible to various fields such as geography, built environment, transportation, forestry, and oceanography. The integration of the web and GIS has led to numerous technological advancements, including smart cities, location-based services, autonomous driving, and pandemic dashboards. This course is designed to equip students with the necessary skills for managing web GIS projects, utilizing the latest geospatial cloud technologies for building modern web GIS applications, and providing real-world case studies for inspiration.

**As ChatGPT continues to gain widespread usage in academia and society, this summer course will explore the potential of utilizing it for assisting Web GIS development.** For example, Its natural language interface can simplify development by enhancing productivity and reducing the learning curve. ChatGPT's error analysis and suggestion capabilities can save time and effort in debugging, while its data analysis capabilities can provide insights into patterns and trends. It can also produce GeoJson data for story maps, making web GIS applications more immersive and engaging for users. ChatGPT's user recommendation feature can provide personalized suggestions, enhancing the user experience and accessibility of web GIS applications.

In order to ensure equal access to web mapping technology, we have made sure that all of the Web GIS applications included in the course materials can be executed, debugged, or further developed on both Windows and Mac OSX operating systems. Additionally, all of the required software and packages are either open-source or free to use. The course is divided into two major components: lectures and lab exercises. During the lectures, students will learn about the theories and principles that underlie Web GIS, such as web architecture, front-end coding, responsive design, and web-based spatial analyses. In the labs, students will have the opportunity to put these theories into practice and develop their skills in web programming and web GIS development.

### Week 3: Dig into the Server Side

<!-- July 4 -->

In this week, we will learn the server side of Web GIS. First, we will study geospatial web servers. A geospatial web server plays a significant role in maintaining web based geospatial application. It stays in the cloud and provides multiple services relevant to geospatial data, such as geospatial data indexing, data format conversation, reprojection, and even spatial analyses. In this week, two geospatial web servers are introduced, including Mapbox (Proprietary) and GeoServer (Open Source). In addition, we will introduce how to make basic thematic maps on the web, also practice how to load geospatial data on the web asynchronously.The web based interactive map is built upon MapBox, which is a popular map library. It not only contains fundamental map related functions, but also offers a lot of cool map features for your use and further explore.

### Week 4: GIS Analysis on the Web

<!-- July 11 -->

In this week, we will introduce you to a series of GIS analysis, including geographical measurement, nearest neighbor analysis, buffer, and isochrone analysis. These analysis are widely used in GIScience and GIS applications. In addition, we will introduce you to the concept of web mapping application programming interface (API). A web mapping API is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing web based geospatial data and services. It is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. In this week, you will learn how to use the Mapbox API and Turf.js to perform GIS analysis on the web.

## Course Requirement

**GitHub:** This course material will be hosted on GitHub instead of UW Canvas. On this dedicated GitHub repository, you can find most of the course material, participate in group discussions by submitting GitHub issues, and create new GitHub repositories to turn in the lab deliverables. By the end of this quarter, you will be more proficient in operating a cloud-based coding environment and able to host your work online as a way to gain public and peer attentions.

**Participation:** You should participate in the ad-hoc discussion items and complete all assigned readings and get familiar with the lab instructions before class meetings.

**Quizzes:** There will be two quizzes in this quarter. Each quiz is designed to test your comprehension of new material. Questions may include multiple choice questions, matching questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, and short answer questions.  Before you answer the questions, please read the following instructions carefully:

- You are forbidden to use ChatGPT or any other AI tools to help you answer the questions.
- Youâll have unlimited time.
- You are welcome to use your notes, course material, and online resources, but you are asked to work alone (not in consultation with your classmates).
- You will be given only one attempt at each quiz.
- After completing the quiz, the first time, you'll see which questions you got right and wrong and get feedback on your answer selections.

**Lab Assignments:** You need to finish all four labs by the due date. ***You are encouraged to work on the lab assignments in groups, However, each student should submit their own work. In addition, you are encouraged to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to finish the Lab Assignments.*** If you have any questions about the lab further, please look for tech support from the instructor.

**Thinkpieces:** Every week, you are required to compose a thinkpiece with a minimum length of 350 words and share it on the Canvas discussion board. Your thinkpiece should delve into your utilization of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Github Copilot, or any other relevant tools, in completing the lab assignment. Once you have posted your thinkpiece, please engage with your classmates' contributions by commenting on or liking at least two of their thinkpieces. To grade your work, I will divide the students into three groups based on the number of likes and comments they receive by the end of the following week. For instance, the thinkpiece submitted in the first week will be evaluated at the conclusion of the second week. Self-generated likes and comments will not be considered in the assessment. Students who receive the highest number of likes and comments will be awarded 7 points, while those who secure the second highest number will earn 6 points. The remaining students who submitted a thinkpiece will receive 5 points.

I invite you to think hard about how race, gender identity, religion, age, citizenship status, first language, ability, sexuality, class, and other axes are at work in our interactions, and what this might mean in terms of when to speak up, when to step back, how to listen, and much more. Each of you is a welcome and invaluable part of our collective whole.

## Disability Accommodations

We welcome the opportunity to work with any students with disabilities in this class to ensure equal access to the course. If you have a letter from Disability Resources for Students (DRS) outlining your academic accommodations, please present the letter to me (or email us, to confirm, if the letter is electronic) as soon as possible so that we can discuss the accommodations you may need for this class. Any discussions between student and professor need to occur as early as possible in order for adequate arrangements to be made. If you do not yet have a letter from DRS, but would like to request academic accommodations due to a disability, please contact DRS [here (Links to an external site.)](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/), or in-person at 011 Mary Gates Hall, or at 206-543-8924 (Voice & Relay), <mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu>.

## Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UWâs policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://https:/registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).

## Copyright

This course advocates for the open culture. The course materials are open source for both students and open source community to access. This course also builds on the work of Bo Zhao, Xiaoqi "Steven" Bao, among many others, who have designed and taught or TA-ed previous iterations of this course.

Notably, students are not allow to videotape or audio-tape (record) this class in any form, and sharing recordings outside of class without the written consent of each student in the class is not permitted by [FERPA](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/). However, I will try to record most of the classes via Zoom and share them via Canvas. Even so, I still encourage each of you attend the lectures instead of watching the recorded videos afterwards. Your in-class participation is a key factor to yield the best learning outcome. The instructor determines if their class can and cannot be recorded. This decision should be clearly communicated by the instructor at the beginning and throughout the quarter. In Zoom, the recording feature can be controlled by the instructor, as the meeting host.
