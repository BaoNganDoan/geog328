**Due:** Dec 12th, by 11:59pm | **Points Available** = 150

The final project is a major component of this course. Each student is expected to develop a web gis application. Your final projects are expected to be published online, and the codes are expected to be shared on GitHub in order to contribute to both the open-source community and academia. The final project must satisfy the following items:

- Host your project on github. By doing so, your project can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`. (15 PNTS)

- your web GIS application should be based on any of the templates (e.g., geocoding, turf based spatial functions, sorting, etc.) that was introduced in Week 7 to 11. If you want to build your final project upon other templates, please contact the Instructor to approve your request.  (25 PNTS)


- You application will have base map and thematic map layers. 
    - You will need to design your own style of base map.  (15 PNTS)
    - The thematic layer(s) must to be hosted in the github repository as geojson data.  (25 PNTS)
    > on your web GIS application, please also incorporate a) legend, asynchronous data loading, title, and b) sidebar, toolbar, or console panel if/when necessary.

- You need to create a `readme.md` file and save it in the root of the final project repository. This description must be **no less than 800 words**. In the repository, please describe the web map. Your description needs to include, but not limited to, the following items:  (40 PNTS)
    - Project title
    - Project description
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?)
    - The application URL (not the repository url)
    - Screenshots
    - Main functions
    - Data sources
    - Applied libraries (e.g., mapbox gl js) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use
    - Other things that are necessary to inform the audience.
    - Acknowledgment

## 2\. Online Presentation  (15 PNTS)

Please create a `new discussion` post to share your project to your classmate in the [discussion board](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog495/discussions/categories/final-project) at our course repository on GitHub. In the post you created, please share the url of your final project github repo and a brief summary of the readme.me file, a screenshot of your web gis application. Please get it done by **Thursday (Dec 8th by 11:59pm)**. 

> A post sample can be find from [here](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog495/discussions/41).

## 3\. Peer Review  (3 PNTS per review，15 PNTS in total)

Each student will need to share some constructive comments to at least **FIVE** of your classmates' final projects. The comments need to be submitted as a new reply to the final project post in [the discussion board](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog495/discussions/categories/final-project). Your comment could start with something the map author does well, and then list a few items the author can improve in the future. Please get it done by **Sunday (Dec 12th by 11:59pm)**.


## 4\. Submission


To submit your final project, you will need to share the url link of your final project's GitHub repository to a dedicated final project submission tab on Canvas by the end of Week 11 on **Sunday (Dec 12th) by 11:59 pm.**
