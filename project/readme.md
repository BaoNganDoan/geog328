# Final Project

**Instructor:** Bo Zhao, 206.685.3846 or zhaobo@uw.edu

**Due:** Monday, March 17th 11:59 PST | **Points Available** = 150

The final project is a major component of this course. Each student group is expected to develop a web gis application. Your final projects are expected to be published online, and the codes are expected to be shared on GitHub in order to contribute to both the open-source community and academia. Each group will need to choose one from the templates listed below for your final project. In principal, each group will have a unique template to build upon their project so that there would be a diversity in the final project. *Therefore, we encourage to connect with your group members as early as possible, since groups that make decisions later will have few options to choose from.*

The final project should satisfy the following items:

- Host your project on github. By doing so, your project can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`. (5pts)

- your web GIS application should be based on any of the templates (e.g., geocoding, turf based spatial functions, sorting, etc.) that was introduced in Week 6 to 9. **A final project is purely built upon your Lab 04 does not meet the requirement.** If you want to build your final project upon other templates, please contact the Instructor to approve your request.  (15pts)

- You application will have base map and thematic map layers. 
    - You will need to design your own style of base map.  (10pts)
    - The geojson data which supports the visualization of the thematic layer(s) must to be hosted in the github.  (25pts)

- You need to create a `readme.md` file and save it in the root of the final project repository. This description must be **no less than 800 words**. In the repository, please describe the web map. Your description needs to include, but not limited to, the following items:  (40pts)
    - Project title (3pts)
    - Project description (9pts)
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?) (9pts)
    - The application URL (not the repository url) (2pts)
    - Screenshots (2pts)
    - Main functions (5pts)
    - Data sources (3pts)
    - Applied libraries (e.g., mapbox gl js) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use (2pts)
    - Acknowledgment (2PNTS)
    - Other things that are necessary to inform the audience.
    - Your `readme.md` file should be well-formatted and free of grammatical errors (3pts)

## Timeline

#### Week 5 - Brainstorm

#### Week 6 - Checkpoint #1: Project proposal (15 PTS)

Please share your final project proposal on this discussion board. A proposal only needs to be shared once by one of your group members. In the proposal, please indicate what you want to make by the end of this quarter, the targeting audience, the available datasets, the required multimedia (e.g., texts, images, videos, etc) if applicable, and the functions. It would be great if you can find one or two digital geographies-related projects that you can learn from. It will give the instructor and TAs a better idea of how to help you. The proposal needs to have **at least 300 words** and one or two screenshots of the available projects that you want to learn from. Once a project proposal is shared, I welcome any suggestions if you have, the TAs and the instructor will participate in the discussion too.

#### Week 7 - Checkpoint #2 Data preparation (10pts)

Data processing is always an important step for creating web GIS applications. Based on past experiences, students may find themselves spending significant amount of time on processing the spatial dataset before they could use it in the proposed web GIS project. Therefore, by the end of week 9, we expect you to have your dataset properly cleaned and processed, so that you could spend the rest of the time working on the coding part of the project. Besides providing the cleaned data, you should also write a few sentences to describe how you cleaned the data and why the data processing steps you take are necessary or beneficial to your final project.

#### Week 10 - Project Presentation (20pts+10pts)

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback. We will hold a final presentation meeting during this week, each group is expected to present the final project in 8 minutes. After each group presents their project, there will be a 3-minute Q&A session during which other groups would ask questions or offer feedbacks. Each group is required to speak at least twice during the Q&A sessions (i.e., ask questions or offer feedbacks after two different presentations). 20 pts will be for the presentation and 5 pts for each question or piece of feedback offered.

## Submission

To submit your final project, you will need to share the url link of your final project's GitHub repository to a dedicated final project submission tab on Canvas by **Monday, March 17th 11:59 PST**.
