**In-class presentation:** **Also, each group will lead the presentation about an assigned item at least once throughout this quarter. We will start assign the group presentation assignment in Week 4.** While we encourage you to be creative and make your presentation engaing to your classmates, we expect to see you cover the following aspects during your presentation. 

1. A brief introduction of the feature/example being presented
2. How this feature/example could be applied to real-life projects/scenarios
   - For example, if the presented example was time-series data vizualization, its real-life application could be tracking landscape change over time, or real-time traffic management
   - It would be even greater if you could find any existing online project that utilizes the feature.
3. The overall structure and the logic flow of the code
4. Code parts that you think need extra attention when programming
5. A working example written by yourself that you would showcase to your classmates

If you prepare slides for the presentation, please send it to the instructor before class via email.
